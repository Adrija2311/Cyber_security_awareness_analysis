The purpose of this report is to assess public awareness of cyber security as it stands . It looks at a number of variables that affect the effectiveness and drawbacks of campaigns to raise awareness of cyber security. It also offers suggestions for raising awareness in order to successfully reduce cyber risks.

##Methods:
As a survey was conducted through gforms to actually understand the awareness among people, near by 50 records were collected. 
To assess the data firstly exploratory data analysis is performed then to classify whether people are aware about cyber security or not , a logistic regression model is fitted. 

##Conclusion:
Thereby , we can say that approximately a large population of people are aware of the importance of cyber security . They know about having backup of important data, using passwords , not using public wifi to open important data , whereas there is lack of knowledge about how to secure their operating systems, not click on unknown links , about phishing emails or how to detect a possible corrupted site. 
Hence cyber security awareness among people has reached half way among people and a lot more study needs to be done
